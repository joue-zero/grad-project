Abstract 
It contains around 100 to 200 words that describe the existing problem, your motivation to solve it, and the tools you are using to implement that solution. In case you are working on a research problem, you should clearly state the research question you are going to answer.  
Background (introduction to the main area of the projects, motivation, beneficiary, main techniques, main application) 
the main area of the project:
The main idea of our project is to create an all in one platform for event planning. It is a website where users can book venues, choose services (like caterers, DJs, or photographers), manage their event details, and even send invitations. Everything happens in one place, without the need to switch between apps, make phone calls, or deal with multiple separate payments. Our main goal is to simplify the whole experience for anyone planning an event while also helping service providers and venue owners grow their businesses online.
Motivation:
Our main motivation was driven by how stressful and time consuming event planning can be especially when people don’t have an all in one system. People usually need to check different platforms, talk to vendors individually, and manually track everything. On the other side a lot of small vendors and venues don’t get the visibility they deserve or they don’t have easy tools to manage and track their bookings.
So we decided to build a solution that brings both sides together on one smooth, modern platform making things easier, faster, and more organized. 
Beneficiary:
Customers who want to easily plan and organize personal events 
Vendors who want more visibility, organized booking tools, and a space to show off their services and packages
Main Techniques
Main Application
Problem definition 
Event planning is a huge process that often cause stress and inefficiency. Customers tend to visit multiple websites or contact different vendors individually to find the right venue, book services, and organize event details. This scattered process leads to confusion, delays, and sometimes missed bookings. On the other hand many vendors and venue owners struggle to attract enough customers because they lack a unified platform to show their services. They also have difficulty managing their availability, bookings, and payments in an organized way. In fact most places organize these things manually. Moreover, existing solutions often focus only on parts of the event planning process such as venue booking or service reservations but none provide a complete, integrated system that covers everything from searching and booking to event management and communication. Our project addresses these gaps by offering a single platform that connects customers, vendors, and admins, enabling smooth coordination, reliable bookings, and effective event management all in one place.
