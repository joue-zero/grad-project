## 🔄 Detailed Process Flow

### **Phase 1: Venue Discovery**
```
Start → Search venues → Check results → Browse options → Select venue
```
- **Loop**: If no results, update filters and search again
- **Loop**: If date unavailable, choose different date or go back

### **Phase 2: Event Association**
```
Add to Cart → Get events → Show dialog → Choose event type → Link/Create event
```
- **Branching**: Existing event selection OR new event creation
- **Convergence**: Both paths merge to cart addition

### **Phase 3: Shopping Experience**
```
Add venue to cart → Continue shopping decision → Add services (loop)
```
- **Flexible loop**: Customer can add multiple services
- **One-stop shopping**: All items added to same cart

### **Phase 4: Checkout Process**
```
Go to cart → Review items → Modify/Proceed decision → Payment processing
```
- **Review opportunity**: Modify cart before payment
- **Single transaction**: Pay for all items together

### **Phase 5: Completion**
```
Payment → Success/Failure → Confirm bookings/Retry → End
```
- **Success path**: Confirm all bookings, clear cart, send notifications
- **Failure path**: Preserve cart, allow retry or cancellation
