## üéØ Architectural Patterns

### **üîπ Microservices Architecture**
- **Independent Deployment** - Services can be deployed separately
- **Technology Diversity** - Each service can use different tech stack
- **Scalability** - Scale services based on demand
- **Fault Isolation** - Failure in one service doesn't crash others
- **Team Autonomy** - Different teams can own different services

### **üîπ Layered Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns** - Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Dependency Direction** - Dependencies flow downward only
- **Abstraction** - Upper layers don't know implementation details
- **Testability** - Each layer can be tested independently

### **üîπ Repository Pattern**
- **Data Abstraction** - Business logic independent of database
- **Unit Testing** - Easy to mock data access layer
- **Database Agnostic** - Can switch database technologies
- **Consistent Interface** - Standardized data operations

### **üîπ Gateway Pattern**
- **Single Entry Point** - All external requests go through gateway
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns** - Authentication, logging, rate limiting
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute requests across service instances
- **API Versioning** - Manage multiple API versions

## üöÄ Scalability Considerations

### **Horizontal Scaling:**
- **Stateless Services** - Services don't maintain session state
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute load across multiple instances
- **Database Sharding** - Partition data across multiple databases
- **Caching Strategy** - Reduce database load with caching layers

### **Performance Optimization:**
- **Caching** - Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data
- **CDN** - Content delivery network for static assets
- **Database Indexing** - Optimize database queries
- **Async Processing** - Background jobs for heavy operations

### **Reliability:**
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Logic** - Handle temporary failures gracefully
- **Health Checks** - Monitor service availability
- **Backup and Recovery** - Data protection and disaster recovery

## üîí Security Architecture

### **Authentication & Authorization:**
- **JWT Tokens** - Stateless authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Different permissions for different user types
- **API Security** - Rate limiting, input validation
- **Data Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

### **External Service Security:**
- **API Keys Management** - Secure storage and rotation
- **HTTPS Only** - All external communications encrypted
- **Input Validation** - Sanitize all external inputs
- **Audit Logging** - Track all security-relevant events

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### **Logging Strategy:**
- **Centralized Logging** - All services log to central system
- **Structured Logging** - JSON formatted logs for easy parsing
- **Correlation IDs** - Track requests across services
- **Log Levels** - Different severity levels for different events

### **Metrics & Analytics:**
- **Business Metrics** - Booking rates, revenue, user engagement
- **Technical Metrics** - Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Real-time Dashboards** - Monitor system health
- **Alerting** - Proactive notification of issues

## üîß Technology Stack Recommendations
