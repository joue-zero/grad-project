# 🎓 Event Planning Platform - System Architecture Documentation

## 📋 Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Event Planning Platform's modular architecture, design patterns, and system functionality. The system is built using a **3-layer architecture** with proper separation of concerns across 9 specialized modules.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Philosophy**

### **3-Layer Architecture Pattern**
```
Controllers (API Layer) → Services (Business Logic) → Models (Data Layer)
```

### **Naming Conventions**
- **Database Models**: Suffixed with `_model` (e.g., `User_model`, `Event_model`)
- **Service Classes**: Descriptive business logic names (e.g., `EventManagementService`)
- **Controllers**: RESTful API endpoints (e.g., `EventController`)

### **Design Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one domain
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries
- **Dependency Injection**: Controllers depend only on services
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Modules aligned with business domains
