A sequence diagram for the "Book Venue" functionality based on your project requirements. 
This will show the interaction between the customer, system components, and other stakeholders during the venue booking process.
Ran tool
I've created a comprehensive sequence diagram for the **"Book Venue"** functionality that covers the complete booking process from your event planning platform.
Here's what the diagram illustrates:

## **Key Components:**
- **Customer**: The user booking the venue
- **Frontend UI**: The web interface
- **Backend API**: Server-side logic
- **Database**: Data storage system
- **Payment Gateway**: Payment processing service
- **Venue Owner**: Receives booking notifications
- **Notification Service**: Handles email/SMS communications

## **Process Flow:**

### **1. Venue Discovery**
- Customer searches with filters (location, date, capacity)
- System queries database and returns available venues
- Customer browses venue options

### **2. Venue Selection & Availability Check**
- Customer selects a specific venue
- System fetches detailed venue information
- Real-time availability check for selected dates
- Display of available time slots

### **3. Booking Process**
- Customer fills booking form with event details
- System validates booking information
- Booking summary is presented to customer

### **4. Payment & Confirmation**
- Customer proceeds to payment
- System creates pending booking record
- Payment gateway processes the transaction
- **Two scenarios**:
  - **Success**: Booking confirmed, notifications sent to both customer and venue owner
  - **Failure**: Booking marked as failed, error message displayed

## **Key Features Highlighted:**
- ✅ **Real-time availability checking**
- ✅ **Secure payment processing**
- ✅ **Automatic notifications**
- ✅ **Booking status management**
- ✅ **Error handling for failed payments**

## **What "alt" means:**

The `alt` block shows **two different possible paths** the system can take based on a condition. In this case, it represents what happens after the payment is processed:

### **The Two Alternatives:**

1️⃣ **"Payment Successful"** (top path):
- Booking status updated to "Confirmed" 
- Confirmation emails sent to customer and venue owner
- Success message displayed to customer
- ✅ **Happy path** - everything works as expected

2️⃣ **"Payment Failed"** (bottom path):  
- Booking status updated to "Failed"
- Error message shown to customer
- ❌ **Error path** - payment didn't go through

## **Why use "alt"?**

In real-world systems, **payment processing can fail** for many reasons:
- Insufficient funds
- Invalid card details  
- Network issues
- Bank rejection

The `alt` block shows that our system **handles both scenarios gracefully** instead of just assuming payment always works.

## **Structure:**
```
alt [Condition]
    // What happens if condition is TRUE
else [Alternative condition]  
    // What happens if condition is FALSE
end
```

This is a standard **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** notation used in sequence diagrams to show **conditional logic** and **alternative flows** in system interactions.
